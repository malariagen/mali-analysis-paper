## Abstract {.page_break_before}

I have not yet written an abstract! 
Basically, malaria is still bad, including in the Sahel. 
We try to compare populations of Anopheles in the region and slightly farther away to try to detect population structure.
In particular, we would like to see if populations aestivate or migrate in the most arid (during the dry season) regions.
There is a some population structure with fairly distant locations but within the Sahel it is pretty weak.
