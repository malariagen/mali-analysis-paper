# Results

## Diversity statistics

- Diversity statistics different between taxa?
- Diversity statistics very similar inside a taxa
- No clear geographical or temporal effect
- Balloon mosquitoes lookn fairly typical
- Some small differences maybe due to different sample sizes
- Very low FST between populations of the same taxon
- Slight indication of population structure when population assignment randomized

## SNPs

- IR profiles are very similar for every population of the same taxon and some are different between taxa?
- Some temporal trends observed elsewhere (para) present here as well but somewhat muddled in some locations
- We have not found any location specific SNP

## CNVs

- I am still unclear on the final result of that analysis

## Haplotypes

- IR haplotypes are highly shared between locations and sometimes taxa?

## Locator

- Pretty good at high level (including on new data)
- Does not work at the required definition

## Doubleton-sharing

- Didn't find a geographical or temporal correlation ?

## IBD

- Still to be seen
